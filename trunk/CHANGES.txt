============================================
- build truck bot
x - clouds that can move with you
- cannon explosions
- effects need to go "around" objects when you walk upwards, or whatever, not get
sucked into the floor, each effect should remember its Z position, somehow...

==========================================
- make coal, water, rubble into tiles
- make cities into sprites
- make isovid.set() smartly make changes to .slayer and other magic
astar layers


2006-03-26========================
- the player sprite is not put in the area where the codes are placed.
    - seems to be a miss match between the code coordinates and the levels.

- the sprites are shown below the levels.

- need to remove the yes/no question after picking up coal.  How do you remove gui elements?



==========================================
- added TODO.txt, BUGS.txt, CHANGES.txt, LICENSE.txt
